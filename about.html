<p>Hi,</p>

<p>My name is Juan Moreno and I'm the author of this blog, to tell you something about me I'm a Christian and also happily married, I work as a developer and as an Electronic Engineer, I like to catalog myself as a technology enthusiast.</p>

<p>From the last 5 years I've been using Java to develop applications and integrate systems, with this I realized that following good practices and develop quality software it is more than an option, it is a responsibility as a professional.</p>

<p>I'm more than pleased of sharing what I've been learning during the past years and what I'll continue learning.</p>

<p>My goal is to help software developers to deliver good quality software following the best practices and applying clean code principles.</p>

<p>If you would like any help on the project that you've been working on or something that you want to start, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
